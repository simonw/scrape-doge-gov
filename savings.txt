We are working to upload all of our receipts in a digestible and transparent manner consistent with applicable rules and regulations. To get started, listed below are a subset of contract, grant, and lease cancellations, representing ~30% of total savings.
The contracts listed below have been posted publicly on fpds.gov. FPDS posting of the contract termination notices can have up to a 1 month lag. There may be discrepencies between FPDS and the posted numbers, the latter of which originate directly from agency contracting officials.
Last updated March 11th, 2025. This will initially be updated weekly; over time, the website will improve and the updates will converge to real-time.
