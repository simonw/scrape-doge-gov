We are working to upload all of our receipts in a digestible and transparent manner consistent with applicable rules and regulations. To get started, listed below are a subset of contract, grant, and lease cancellations, representing ~30% of total savings.
The contracts listed below have been posted publicly on fpds.gov. FPDS posting of the contract termination notices can have up to a 1 month lag. There may be discrepencies between FPDS / USAspending and the posted numbers, the latter of which originate directly from agency contracting and grant officials.
Last updated March 19th, 2025. This will initially be updated weekly; over time, the website will improve and the updates will converge to real-time.
